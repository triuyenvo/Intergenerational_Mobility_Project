# Intergenerational_Mobility_Project
My Data Analytics senior capstone project on Intergenerational Mobility (IGM).
## 1. Project Summary
This study looks into the relationship between global IGM and inequality while factoring in regional differences. It also tries to re-classify IGM levels by examining the educational mobility in different countries.

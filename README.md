# Intergenerational_Mobility_Project
My Data Analytics senior capstone project on Intergenerational Mobility (IGM).
## 1. Project Summary

Intergenerational mobility (IGM) is a critical measure of societal equality and economic opportunity. This study aimed to conduct segmentation analysis on 153 countries using two variable sets: rank-based mobility measures (rank-based variables) and transition matrix measures (transition variables). Through k-means classification, we identified four clusters for each variable set that showed face-value validation through visualization. However, further mixed-method validation suggested limited discriminatory power of the clusters, hence no further support for our classification models. These results suggest over-reliance on The World Bankâ€™s pre-derived mobility measures and their lack of accuracy. They also suggest a potential  non-monotonic relationship between IGM and inequality, which needs more in-depth examination. Future research should try to derive a specific formal indicator for educational IGM. Segmentation attempts could broaden the current educational scope to include other domains of IGM, considering intersectional topics.

## 4. Data and variables 
#### 4.1. Global Database On Intergenerational Mobility (GDIM; The World Bank, 2023; Van Der Weide et al., 2021)  [Link](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0050771/global-database-on-intergenerational-mobility)
The GDIM included summary survey data from 153 countries collected between 1991 and 2017, representing 97% of the world population. It contained evaluations of IGM in education for 10-year cohorts, encompassing individuals born from 1940 to 1989. This dataset had been cleaned and synthesized by its collector.
- Mobility metrics derived from previous report by Van Der Weide et al. (2021):
  - CAT: absolute mobility measure 1
  - YOS: absolute mobility measure 2
  - 1-COR: relative mobility measure 1
  - 1-BETA: relative mobility measure 2
- Rank-based mobility measures: 12 variables that showed the percentage of children who ended up in different quartiles of the education hierarchy, given that their parents were at the bottom half
- Transition measures: 25 variables that showed the movements in educational attainment after one generation on the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) scale
- Year of survey collection
#### 4.2. Global Gini Index Data (GGID; The World Bank, 2024). [Link](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI?)
This dataset contained annual Gini indices of 266 countries from 1963 to 2022 (retrieval date: Feb 28th, 2024).
- Inequality: measured through the Gini index (The World Bank, 2023)
- Year of survey collection

## 5. Statistical analyses
- K-means clustering: unsupervised classification method that partitions data points into a predetermined number of clusters by iteratively assigning each point to the nearest centroid and updating the centroids based on the mean of the points assigned to them. The end results are n clusters (n being pre-determined, in this case n=4)
- Principle Component Analysis: a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving most of the original variance
- Analyses of Variance: statistical test that assesses whether the means of two or more groups are statistically different from each other
- Tukey's post hoc: statistical method used after ANOVA to determine which specific groups differ significantly from each other in terms of their means
- Mix-method validation (see paper)
